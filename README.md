# CS305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates financial plans for clients. They wanted me to improve their web application’s security by adding encryption, verifying data integrity, and fixing vulnerabilities.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I made sure to fix the full extent of the issue, not just one portion. Secure coding is important because it protects sensitive data and prevents cyber threats, helping the company maintain trust and reliability.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Learning how to use and read the vulnerability report was challenging, but I caught on quickly. It helped me identify outdated dependencies and security risks that needed to be fixed.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I used a consistent cycle of manual and static testing to increase layers of security. This method ensures that vulnerabilities are always caught and mitigated effectively.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To confirm that the application was functional and secure, I ran dependency scans and manual tests after refactoring. I verified that no new vulnerabilities were introduced and that the application still worked as expected.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Maven, and Spring Boot security configurations, which will be useful for future projects. Secure coding practices like HTTPS implementation and checksum verification are also key takeaways.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would showcase my ability to build secure applications by sharing my code and explaining how I implemented security best practices to protect user data.
